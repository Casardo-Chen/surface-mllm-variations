Across all models, Germany is identified as having the highest number of Americans claiming ancestry, totaling 45,000,000 individuals, and Germany, along with the UK, is highlighted as a significant source of European ancestry due to historical immigration patterns.",
    "uniqueness": "Unique mentions from Claude include Romania at 1,100,000, Austria at 1,300,000, Netherlands at 1,200,000, Switzerland at 1,300,000, and Iceland at 54,000. Spain's figure of 1,000,000 is only noted by Gemini, and Norway's figure of 4,500,000 is uniquely attributed to GPT. This individual mention of additional European ancestries suggests varying depths of detail and emphasis on lesser-reported ancestries.",

For Ireland, ancestry figures range from 31,000,000 according to some GPT outputs, to 34,000,000 per Gemini. England's ancestry figures are disputed, with Gemini listing it at 54,000,000, while GPT lists 24,000,000 for England separately. Additionally, Claude mentions the UK as 34,000,000. Italy's numbers range from 16,000,000 (Claude, Gemini) to 18,000,000 (GPT). French ancestry figures are 8,000,000 (Claude, Gemini) or 10,000,000 (GPT). Sweden is listed with figures of 3,400,000 (GPT, Claude, Gemini) or 3,800,000 (GPT). For Portugal, figures range from 1,300,000 (GPT, Gemini) to 1,900,000 (Claude). Greece shows a minor discrepancy: 1,200,000 (GPT, Claude, Gemini). Norway's 4,500,000 figure is mentioned by GPT only, creating confusion."
