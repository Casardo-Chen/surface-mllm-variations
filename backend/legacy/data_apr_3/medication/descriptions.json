The label has \"Berry\" prominently displayed in red text. There's a green cap on the bottle, and it seems to indicate \"strength\" somewhere on the label. The bottle also has some text on the side panel which appears to contain nutritional information or directions, but it's not clearly legible in this image. The bottle is sitting on what looks like a white surface, next to what appears to be a dark leather case or bag with some furry or fuzzy material visible at the edge."

Without being able to see the complete label clearly, I cannot definitively identify the specific brand name of this supplement."
