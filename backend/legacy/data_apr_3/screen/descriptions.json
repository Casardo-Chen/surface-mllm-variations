The first spike is labeled \"Hurricane Katrina\" and shows a dramatic increase where prices reached approximately $34.00 at the highest point before declining. There appears to be a second significant price spike as well.\n\nThe vertical axis (y-axis) shows price values ranging from approximately $0.00 at the bottom to $34.00 near the top, with intermediate values like $2.00, $4.00, $6.00, $8.00, $22.00, and others marked.\n\nThe horizontal axis (x-axis) appears to show dates, though they're somewhat difficult to read clearly in this image. The timeline seems to extend from approximately 2004-2005 through to around 2009-2010 based on what's partially visible. The maximum value on the x-axis appears to be a date in the late 2000s, but I cannot make out the exact final date with certainty due to the image resolution and angle.\n\nThis chart likely depicts the price impact of Hurricane Katrina (which occurred in August 2005) on some commodity, possibly natural gas, gasoline, or another energy resource that was affected by the disaster."

There are two notable spikes in the graph - one labeled \"Hurricane Katrina\" which shows a dramatic rise to approximately $14-16 per unit before dropping back down, and another spike that appears to be related to a 2008 occurrence (though the label is partially visible).\n\nThe y-axis shows price values ranging from $0 at the bottom to approximately $14-16 at the highest points. The blue line represents the price movements over time.\n\nThe x-axis appears to show dates, with what looks like months and years spanning from around 2004-2005 through approximately 2010-2011, based on the visible timeline. However, I cannot definitively state the maximum value of the x-axis as the rightmost date labels are not clearly legible in this somewhat blurry image. The timeline appears to be showing monthly or quarterly intervals over what seems to be a 5-7 year period.\n\nThe chart seems to be documenting price impacts of major events, with Hurricane Katrina (which occurred in August 2005) having a particularly significant effect on whatever commodity or financial instrument is being tracked."
