The dial currently appears to be set to the \"Normal\" cycle, which is marked in blue text. There's also a \"Casual\" setting visible.\n\nLooking at the control panel, I don't specifically see a \"Heavy Load\" setting labeled on the visible portion of the dial. Based on typical washing machine layouts, you would likely need to turn the dial counterclockwise to access cycles designed for heavier loads, which might be labeled as \"Heavy Duty,\" \"Bulky,\" or something similar. These more intensive cycles are typically positioned before the \"Normal\" setting when moving counterclockwise.\n\nThe machine is connected to water supply lines with blue shutoff valves visible in the wall connection box to the right of the control panel. The background shows a wall with red and white striped wallpaper or paneling."

From typical washing machine layouts, you would likely need to turn the dial counterclockwise from the Normal position to reach heavier duty wash settings.
