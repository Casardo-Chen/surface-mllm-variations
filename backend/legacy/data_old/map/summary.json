Norway and the Netherlands also exhibit some variability, with numbers ranging distinctly across models, as Claude exclusively reports a lower figure for Norway at 3,400,000 compared to GPT's higher 4,500,000.",
    "disagreement": "There are discrepancies in the data for Ireland, reported as 31,000,000, 34,000,000, or 54,000,000 descendants, with Claude citing the highest number. Similarly, the figures for the United Kingdom or its constituent parts vary significantly, ranging from 8,000,000 to 54,000,000, differing notably between Claude and Gemini. The ancestry figure for France also shows disparity, listed at 1,200,000, 8,000,000, or 10,000,000 across models."
