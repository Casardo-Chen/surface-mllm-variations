The bottle has a pink label that says \"Berry\" prominently on it, and appears to be a vitamin or supplement product. I can see part of what looks like \"Strength\" on the label, and there's a yellow and red color scheme on parts of the label.\n\nThe image is somewhat blurry and at an angle, making it difficult to read all the text clearly. I can see there's a section of text on the side panel that likely contains ingredients and warnings, but the specific details aren't legible. From what's visible, this appears to be some kind of berry-flavored nutritional supplement, but I cannot make out the complete brand name from this image."
