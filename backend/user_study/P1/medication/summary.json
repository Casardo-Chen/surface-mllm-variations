    "similarity": "- The image shows a prescription medication bottle or container with a dark blue/navy body and a white cap, sitting on a light-colored or white surface.\n- The bottle is from a drugstore or pharmacy, with the name partially visible and the phone number 1-800-461-0974 on the label.\n- A prescription label is wrapped around the bottle, including a barcode.\n- The medication is noted as being extended-release (XR).\n- Instructions suggest the medication is to be taken orally, daily, with specifics like swallowing whole, and not breaking or crushing.\n- The date 02-Feb-25 is present on the label, with 0 refills available for the prescription.",
    "uniqueness": "- GPT specifies the name of the pharmacy as 'Drugstore,' whereas Claude refers to it as '...store' and Gemini as 'agstore.'\n- Gemini provides additional details about the medication's class, stating it as an antidepressant of the SNRI class or an antidepressant/anti-anxiety medication.\n- Claude uniquely mentions that prescription labels contain private health information that should be kept confidential.\n- Gemini emphasizes the illegality and dangers of sharing prescription medications and points out the unreliability of identifying medications from images alone.",
    "disagreement": "- GPT identifies the medication as potentially Venlafaxine XR, Guanfacine XR 1 mg, or Alprazolam XR, while Gemini specifically identifies it as Venlafaxine XR.\n- The patient's name is mentioned as Verrier Michel by Gemini, but GPT mentions both Verrier Michel and Michel Verrier.\n- Some instructions and information are noted to be partially obscured or not fully visible, which is a point raised with variability across models."
