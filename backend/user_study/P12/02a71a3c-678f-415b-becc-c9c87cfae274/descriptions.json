        "description": "It's difficult to decipher all of the signatures with certainty due to the image quality and the way some of the signatures overlap. However, some signatures can be partially or fully identified:\n\n* **Top ball:** This one has several signatures, but the most prominent one appears to be near the top written in light blue ink. It is hard to make out, but potentially starts with a \"T\" or \"J\".\n\n* **Right ball:**  This has a prominent signature that looks like \"Ron Diorio\" or a similar variation.\n\n* **Left ball:** Several signatures in blue are present but are difficult to read fully due to overlapping. There appear to be numbers (possibly \"829\") included as well.\n\n* **Bottom ball:**  This ball has a signature that looks like it might start with \"C\" or \"G\".  There are multiple other signatures in blue ink that overlap, making them difficult to read. One of them may read \"Lieurance.\"\n\nIt's important to note that without higher resolution images or clearer views, these are just best guesses based on what's visible. Authentication from a reputable autograph expert would be required to definitively identify any of these signatures.",
