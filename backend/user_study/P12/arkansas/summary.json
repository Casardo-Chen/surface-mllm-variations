    "uniqueness": "- The focus on Arkansas with a bold or black outline is unique to Claude.\n- Gemini uniquely notes cities like Hot Springs, Little Rock, West Memphis, and Arkadelphia in the discussions of various risk zones.\n- Claude and Gemini together detail the Marginal Risk as covering the eastern and western borders or extending beyond other severe areas across the state, while GPT provides a less specific description.",
    "disagreement": "- There are significant disagreements in which cities fall under the categories of Enhanced and Slight Risk. Gemini places more emphasis on cities being in Moderate or Enhanced Risk (e.g., Mountain Home, Harrison, Batesville) compared to GPT and Claude.\n- GPT mentions no cities entirely within High Risk (Red), whereas Gemini points to Mountain Home being close to a High-Risk border.\n- One report (GPT) uses inconsistent color associations for risk levels.\n- Contrasting views exist about the Thunderstorm area, which is described variably the outermost, far eastern, or at state corners, and one report states no areas were only marked for Thunderstorms (GPT)."
