    "model_diff": "*   **General Layout and Appearance**\n    *   The dishwasher control panel is located on the top edge of the door (1 of 3 GPT, 3 of 3 Gemini). It presents a horizontal (2 of 3 GPT), black (3 of 3 Gemini), and sleek (1 of 3 Gemini) layout featuring white lettering (2 of 3 GPT, 3 of 3 Gemini) and potentially red accents or highlights (2 of 3 Gemini). The Electrolux brand logo is positioned on the far left (3 of 3 GPT, 3 of 3 Gemini). A digital display might be present near the main controls or on the far right for timing and status information (1 of 3 GPT, 1 of 3 Gemini).\n\n*   **Button and Indicator Sections**\n    *   **Cycles**: Situated on the left side (1 of 3 GPT, 3 of 3 Gemini) under a \"CYCLES\" label (2 of 3 Gemini), this section houses horizontally aligned buttons (1 of 3 GPT) allowing selection of the wash cycle. The available cycles, typically listed from left to right (1 of 3 GPT, 2 of 3 Gemini), are Auto, Heavy, Normal, Fast, and Rinse (3 of 3 GPT, 3 of 3 Gemini).\n    *   **Options**: Located in the middle (1 of 3 GPT) or to the right of the cycle buttons (1 of 3 GPT, 3 of 3 Gemini) under an \"OPTIONS\" label (2 of 3 Gemini), this group offers additional settings. These include Hi Temp, Sanitize, Heat Dry, and Delay (3 of 3 GPT, 3 of 3 Gemini). The Heat Dry option may require holding for 3 seconds to lock and can feature a small square icon (2 of 3 Gemini). The Delay function allows setting a delayed start time, indicated as 1-24 hours (2 of 3 Gemini) or offering 2, 4, or 8-hour settings (1 of 3 GPT).\n    *   **Main Controls**: Positioned towards or on the right side (1 of 3 GPT, 1 of 3 Gemini), this area includes the Start button, described as having white text (2 of 3 GPT, 1 of 3 Gemini) or being a green button (2 of 3 Gemini), and the Cancel button, shown with red text (1 of 3 GPT, 1 of 3 Gemini) or as a red button (2 of 3 Gemini).\n    *   **Status Indicators**: Found on the far right (1 of 3 GPT, 3 of 3 Gemini) and often arranged vertically (1 of 3 GPT, 3 of 3 Gemini), these indicators illuminate (1 of 3 Gemini) to show the current status of the dishwasher's operation (1 of 3 GPT, 2 of 3 Gemini). The indicators typically include Washing (1 of 3 GPT, 3 of 3 Gemini), Drying (1 of 3 GPT, 3 of 3 Gemini), Clean (2 of 3 GPT, 3 of 3 Gemini), and Sanitized (3 of 3 GPT, 3 of 3 Gemini).",


    "similarity": "- The dishwasher control panel is located on the top edge of the door, is black, and sleek with white lettering. The Electrolux brand logo is on the far left.\n- A digital display may be present near the main controls or on the far right for timing and status information.\n- The 'Cycles' section is on the left and includes buttons for Auto, Heavy, Normal, Fast, and Rinse cycles.\n- The 'Options' section offers Hi Temp, Sanitize, Heat Dry, and Delay options.\n- The 'Status Indicators' are on the far right and often arranged vertically, showing Washing, Drying, Clean, and Sanitized statuses.",
    "uniqueness": "- Claude does not provide a description for this dishwasher panel;\n- Gemini notes a 'CYCLES' and 'OPTIONS' label, a small square icon for the Heat Dry, and the option to hold the button to lock.\n- The 'OPTIONS' section, according to Gemini, might be to the right of the cycle buttons.",
    "disagreement": "- GPT suggests the control panel features white lettering and possibly red accents, while Gemini adds these accents specifically.\n- GPT says the delay is set as 2, 4, or 8-hour settings; Gemini specifies 1-24 hours.\n- GPT describes the Start button with white text and Cancel with red text, whereas Gemini presents the Start button as green and Cancel as red."
