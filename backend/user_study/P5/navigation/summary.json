    "model_diff": "## Aisle Overview\n*   **General Setting**: The setting is described as a grocery store aisle (2 of 2 Claude).\n*   **Obstacles**: The aisle contains merchandise (1 of 2 Claude), cardboard boxes on the floor (2 of 2 Claude, 2 of 2 Gemini), including potentially four stacked boxes (1 of 2 Gemini), an open box (1 of 2 Gemini), a stack in the middle (1 of 2 Claude), or red boxes stacked on the right (1 of 2 Gemini), along with orange and white packaged items or fallen orange packages (1 of 2 Claude, 2 of 2 Gemini). There are also two store workers stocking shelves or unpacking inventory (2 of 2 Claude, 2 of 2 Gemini). These obstacles are noted as potentially temporary due to active stocking, so their exact placement might change (1 of 2 Claude).\n*   **Pathway**: The navigable pathway appears to be about 3-4 feet wide between obstacles (1 of 2 Claude), suggesting enough space for careful navigation (1 of 2 Claude). The suggested path is along the right side (1 of 2 Claude) or through the center (1 of 2 Claude).\n\n## Navigation Instructions\n*   **Initial Steps**:\n    *   Begin by moving forward approximately 3 feet (1 of 2 Gemini) or 5 feet (1 of 2 Gemini) or 5-6 feet (1 of 2 Claude) or 10-15 feet (1 of 2 Claude).\n    *   Maneuver around or carefully step over the orange packages (1 of 2 Claude, 2 of 2 Gemini).\n    *   Navigate around or step over the first set of stacked cardboard boxes (2 of 2 Claude, 2 of 2 Gemini), potentially by turning slightly right (1 of 2 Claude, 1 of 2 Gemini) or staying in the center (1 of 2 Claude).\n*   **Continuing Through the Aisle**:\n    *   Proceed forward for another 5 feet (1 of 2 Gemini) or 8 feet (1 of 2 Gemini) or 8-10 feet (1 of 2 Claude) or 10 feet (1 of 2 Gemini) or 12 feet (1 of 2 Gemini).\n    *   Maintain position towards the right side (1 of 2 Claude) or within the aisle between shelves (1 of 2 Gemini) or in the center (1 of 2 Claude).\n    *   Navigate around an open cardboard box if present (1 of 2 Gemini).\n*   **Passing Workers and Further Obstacles**:\n    *   Continue forward approximately 15 feet (1 of 2 Gemini) or 15-20 feet (1 of 2 Gemini).\n    *   Carefully avoid or pass the workers stocking shelves (2 of 2 Claude, 2 of 2 Gemini), potentially passing between the right-side shelving and boxes (1 of 2 Claude) or passing red boxes stacked on the right (1 of 2 Gemini).\n*   **Final Section and Warnings**:\n    *   Continue straight ahead to exit this section or reach the back of the store (1 of 2 Claude, 2 of 2 Gemini).\n    *   Remain watchful for and avoid any other or additional hidden obstacles like boxes or carts (2 of 2 Claude, 2 of 2 Gemini).\n    *   Adjust direction as needed if the destination is not straight ahead (1 of 2 Gemini).",

    "similarity": "- The setting is a grocery store aisle with various obstacles present.\n- Obstacles include cardboard boxes on the floor, orange and white packaged items, and workers stocking shelves.\n- There is a clear navigable pathway through the aisle, although its width varies slightly.\n- The navigation involves maneuvering around these obstacles carefully and includes guidance to continue straight and watch for additional hidden obstacles.",
    "uniqueness": "- Gemini describes possible configurations of boxes as potentially four stacked or an open box.\n- Gemini specifies the need to navigate around an open cardboard box, which is not mentioned by Claude.",
    "disagreement": "- Initial steps vary: Claude suggests beginning by moving 5-6 feet or 10-15 feet, while Gemini suggests 3 feet or 5 feet.\n- Pathway guidance differs: Claude mentions a path along the right side or through the center, while Gemini does not specify this.\n- Directions for further aisle navigation vary in measurements of distance (e.g., 8-10 feet by Claude, compared to 5, 8, 10, or 12 feet by Gemini)."
