    "similarity": "- The image is blurry and out-of-focus, contributing to an abstract appearance with indistinct details.\n- A dominant orange background is prevalent across the models' descriptions.\n- Light blue, teal, or bluish-green hues and blurred streaks are noted in the lower portion of the image.",
    "uniqueness": "- Claude uniquely describes the object as having a grid-like appearance, interpreting it as a glass or decorative container.\n- Gemini identifies the orange background as burnt orange and specifies the appearance of a small patch of red in the bottom right corner.\n- GPT uniquely mentions hints of pinkish hues towards the edges of the image.",
    "disagreement": "- GPT describes the central subject as white or light-colored text that is blurred, Claude sees it as a cut crystal or glass object with geometric patterns, and Gemini interprets it as a stylized design resembling a spine or segmented ladder.\n- Claude notes color shifts including orange and white, while other models do not specifically mention these shifts."
