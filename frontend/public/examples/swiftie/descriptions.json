However, it's possible other terms appear in multiple albums at lower frequencies that might be harder to discern from the graph.\n\nThe data shows a clear evolution in Swift's lyrical content regarding alcohol references, with her earlier albums containing few to no mentions, while Reputation contains a significant increase in both frequency and variety of alcohol terminology."
